# Edge
* Works with opal-rspec 0.4.3 and with >= 0.5.0beta2
* Fixes autorun issue with 0.8.0
* Put groundwork in place for other testing frameworks besides RSpec
* config.assets.debug = false, although source maps are not supported in this case, opal-rails will roll up source + test assets into 1 file when this setting is enabled (just like Rails+Sprockets will roll everything up into 'application.js')

# 0.8.0 2015-07-20

* Opal 0.8
* Default spec location is now `spec-opal`, this will allow opal specs to be "alphabetically" near other specs.
* Don't run the sourcemap server unless sprockets is active and sourcemaps enabled and sprockets is in debug mode
* Align spec compilation done via `rake opal:spec` vs. in the browser at `/opal_spec`
* Dynamic require severity now defaults to `:ignore`
* Make `#opal_tag` helper respect provided options + specs
* Sprockets bootstrap code can be skipped from `javascript_include_tag` passing `skip_opal_loader: true`
* All specs now need to `require "opal"` and `require "opal-rspec"` explicitly


# 0.7.0 2015-02-02

# 0.6.3 2014-03-07

* Add `opal_tag` helper, similar to `javascript_tag`
* Allow specs inside subdirectories
* Updated to Opal v0.6

# 0.6.2 2013-12-13

* Added fun
* Expire Sprockets cache (by means of using different cache keys) when the opal version changes (monkeypatch)
* Rely on `Opal::Processor` to know if source maps are enabled

# 0.6.0 2013-11-05

# 0.5.2 2013-09-05

* Add the `rake opal:spec` task to run browser specs from the terminal (requires phantomjs)


# 0.5.1 2013-07-02

* `.js` suffix is now optional for in-browser specs


# 0.5.0 2013-06-30

* Add support for source-maps
