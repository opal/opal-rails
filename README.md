_Rails (3.2+) bindings for [Opal Ruby](http://opalrb.org) (v0.3.27) engine._



## Installation

In your `Gemfile`

``` ruby
gem 'opal-rails'
```



## Usage


### Asset Pipeline

``` js
// app/assets/application.js

// The Opal runtime
// = require opal
//
// Dom manipulation
// = require jquery
// = require opal-jquery
```

and then just use the `.rb` or `.opal` extensions:

```ruby
# app/assets/javascripts/hi-world.js.rb

puts "G'day world!" # check the console
```




### As a template

You can use it for your views too, it even inherits instance and local variables from actions:

```ruby
# app/controllers/posts_controller.rb

def create
  @post = Post.create!(params[:post])
  render type: :js, locals: {comments_html: render_to_string(@post.comments)}
end
```

Each assign is filtered through JSON so it's reduced to basic types:

```ruby
# app/views/posts/cerate.js.opal

Document['.post .title'].html    = @post[:title]
Document['.post .body'].html     = @post[:body]
Document['.post .comments'].html = comments_html
```


### As an Haml filter (optional)

Of course you need to require `haml-rails` separately since its presence is not assumed

```haml
-# app/views/posts/show.html.haml

%article.post
  %h1.title= post.title
  .body= post.body

%a#show-comments Display Comments!

.comments(style="display:none;")
  - post.comments.each do |comment|
    .comment= comment.body

:opal
  Document.ready? do
    Document['#show-comments'].on :click do
      Document['.comments'].first.show
      false
    end
  end
```


### Spec!

Add a `spec.js` into `assets/javascripts` to require your specs

```js
// = require_tree ./spec
```

and then a spec folder with you specs!

```ruby
# assets/javascripts/spec/example_spec.js.rb

describe 'a spec' do
  it 'has successful examples' do
    'I run'.should =~ /run/
  end
end
```

Then visit `/opal_spec` from your app and **reload at will**.

## (Rails) Caveats

During eager loading (e.g. in production or test env) Rails loads all `.rb` files inside `app/` thus catching Opal files inside `app/assets` or `app/views`, the workaround for this is to add the following code to `application.rb`

```ruby
# Don't eager load stuff from app/assets and app/views
config.before_initialize do
  config.eager_load_paths = config.eager_load_paths.dup - Dir["#{Rails.root}/app/{assets,views}"]
end
```

**NOTE:** Rails does not do this on purpose, but the paths system (which states no eager loading for assets/views) is caught in a corner case here. I opened [an issue](rails/rails#7587) on Rails already.
