_Rails bindings for [Opal Ruby](http://opalrb.org) engine. ([Changelog](https://github.com/opal/opal-rails/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md))_



## Installation

In your `Gemfile`

```ruby
gem 'opal-rails'
```

or when you build your new Rails app:

```bash
rails new <app-name> --javascript=opal
```


### Configuration

Add your configuration in `config/application.rb` with the following contents:

```ruby
module MyApp
  class Application < Rails::Application
    # These are the available options with their default value:
    config.opal.method_missing      = true
    config.opal.optimized_operators = true
    config.opal.arity_check         = false
    config.opal.const_missing       = true
    config.opal.dynamic_require_severity = :ignore

    # Enable/disable /opal_specs route
    config.opal.enable_specs        = true

    config.opal.spec_location = 'spec-opal'
		
    # This is the default. At some point in the future, using another test_runner besides RSpec will be supported
    config.opal.test_runner = 'Opal::RSpec::Runner.autorun'
  end
end
```


### Gotchas

<del>After changing the version of the `opal` gem (e.g. via `bundle update opal`) or any configuration flag **you should trash the `#{Rails.root}/tmp/cache/assets` folder**, otherwise you could see a cached source compiled before the change.</del>

Now ships with a patch to sprockets cache key to include processor version that is also in this [pull request](https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets/pull/508).



## Usage


### Asset Pipeline

You can rename `app/assets/javascripts/application.js` to `application.js.rb`. Even if not necessary, it is recommended to change Sprockets' `//= require` statements to Ruby' `require` methods.
Sprockets' `//= require` statements won't be known by the opal builder and therefore you can end up adding something twice.

For Opal 0.7 and below, the following example should work:

```ruby
# app/assets/javascripts/application.js.rb

#= require opal
#= require opal_ujs
#= require turbolinks
#= require_tree .
```

For Opal 0.8 and above, you have to use `application.js.rb` with the following syntax:

```ruby
# app/assets/javascripts/application.js.rb

require 'opal'
require 'opal_ujs'
require 'turbolinks'
require_tree '.'
```

If you want to use `application.js`, you need to `load` the Opal modules(files) manually, e.g.:

```
// application.js
//= require opal
//= require greeter
//= require_self
Opal.load('greeter');
```

As you see in the example above, Opal also gives you a Ruby equivalent of `//= require_tree`.

Opal requires are forwarded to the Asset Pipeline at compile time (similarly to what happens for RubyMotion). You can use either the `.rb` or `.opal` extension:

```ruby
# app/assets/javascripts/greeter.js.rb

puts "G'day world!" # check the console!

# Dom manipulation
require 'opal-jquery'

Document.ready? do
  Element.find('body > header').html = '<h1>Hi there!</h1>'
end
```




### As a template

You can use it for your views too, it even inherits instance and local variables from actions:

```ruby
# app/controllers/posts_controller.rb

def create
  @post = Post.create!(params[:post])
  render type: :js, locals: {comments_html: render_to_string(@post.comments)}
end
```

Each assign is filtered through JSON so it's reduced to basic types:

```ruby
# app/views/posts/create.js.opal

post = Element.find('.post')
post.find('.title').html    = @post[:title]
post.find('.body').html     = @post[:body]
post.find('.comments').html = comments_html
```


### As a Haml filter (optional)

Of course you need to require `haml-rails` separately since its presence is not assumed

```haml
-# app/views/posts/show.html.haml

%article.post
  %h1.title= post.title
  .body= post.body

%a#show-comments Display Comments!

.comments(style="display:none;")
  - post.comments.each do |comment|
    .comment= comment.body

:opal
  Document.ready? do
    Element.find('#show-comments').on :click do |click|
      click.prevent_default
      click.current_target.hide
      Element.find('.comments').effect(:fade_in)
    end
  end

```


### Spec!

Add specs into `/spec-opal`:

and then a spec folder with you specs!

```ruby
# spec-opal/example_spec.js.rb
require 'opal'
require 'opal-rspec'

describe 'a spec' do
  it 'has successful examples' do
    'I run'.should =~ /run/
  end
end
```

Then visit `/opal_spec` from your app and **reload at will** or use the command line with `rake opal:spec`.

Note that `opal` and `opal-rspec` need to be required explicitly in the spec file or in a `spec_helper.rb` as follows:

```ruby
# spec_helper.rb
require 'opal'
require 'opal-rspec'
```

```ruby
# spec-opal/example_spec.js.rb
require 'spec_helper'

describe 'a spec' do
  it 'has successful examples' do
    'I run'.should =~ /run/
  end
end
```

That is to allow having specs that make use of [`opal-minitest`](https://rubygems.org/gems/opal-minitest) or another testing library.

#### CHANGE from versions pre 0.7.1

Specs used to run out of app/assets/javascripts/spec which was problematic because require_tree . would cause opal/sprockets to compile the specs for non spec running.  This could result in bad specs that prevent your application Opal code from compiling, and even if it compiles you'll get exceptions about the test framework methods not being defined.  To address this, specs have been moved out of the app/assets/javascripts to Rails.root/spec-opal.  The name spec-opal was chosen to put it close to the spec directory.  We don't want to put specs in spec directory because we don't want the "backend" rspec to run those.

The location of specs is configurable. To restore the old location of app/assets/javascripts/spec add an initializer file like the below.

```ruby
# config/initializers/opal.rb
Rails.application.config.opal.spec_location = "app/assets/javascripts/spec"

```

Similarly, you can put the opal specs in another location via a similar initializer call.

### Shared templates

As long as the templates are inside the sprockets/opal load path, then you should be able to just require them.

Let's say we have this template `app/views/shared/test.haml`:

```haml
.row
  .col-sm-12
    = @bar
```

We need to make sure Opal can see and compile that template. So we need to add the path to sprockets:

```ruby
# config/initializers/opal.rb
Rails.application.config.assets.paths << Rails.root.join('app', 'views', 'shared').to_s
```

Now, somewhere in `application.rb` you need to require that template, and you can just run it through `Template`:

```ruby
# app/assets/javascripts/application.rb
require 'opal'
require 'opal-haml'
require 'test'

@bar = "hello world"

template = Template['test']
template.render(self)
# =>  '<div class="row"><div class="col-sm-12">hello world</div></div>'
```
