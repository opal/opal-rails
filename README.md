_Rails bindings for [Opal Ruby](http://opalrb.org) engine. ([Changelog](https://github.com/opal/opal-rails/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md))_



## Installation

In your `Gemfile`

```ruby
gem 'opal-rails'
```

or when you build your new Rails app:

```bash
rails new <app-name> --javascript=opal
```


### Configuration

Add your configuration in `config/application.rb` with the following contents:

```ruby
module MyApp
  class Application < Rails::Application
    # These are the available options with their default values

    # Compiler options
    config.opal.method_missing      = true
    config.opal.optimized_operators = true
    config.opal.arity_check         = false
    config.opal.const_missing       = true
    config.opal.dynamic_require_severity = :ignore

    # Enable/disable /opal_specs route
    config.opal.enable_specs = true

    # The path to opal specs from Rails.root
    config.opal.spec_location = 'spec-opal'
  end
end
```


## Usage


### Asset Pipeline

You can rename `app/assets/javascripts/application.js` to `application.js.rb`. Even if not necessary, it is recommended to change Sprockets' `//= require` statements to Ruby' `require` methods.
Sprockets' `//= require` statements won't be known by the opal builder and therefore you can end up adding something twice.

For Opal 0.8 and above, you have to use `application.js.rb` with the following syntax:

```ruby
# app/assets/javascripts/application.js.rb

require 'opal'
require 'opal_ujs'
require 'turbolinks'
require_tree '.'
```

If you want to use `application.js`, you need to `load` the Opal modules(files) manually, e.g.:

```
// application.js
//= require opal
//= require greeter
//= require_self
Opal.load('greeter');
```

As you see in the example above, Opal also gives you a Ruby equivalent of `//= require_tree`.

Opal requires are forwarded to the Asset Pipeline at compile time (similarly to what happens for RubyMotion). You can use either the `.rb` or `.opal` extension:

```ruby
# app/assets/javascripts/greeter.js.rb

puts "G'day world!" # check the console!

# Dom manipulation
require 'opal-jquery'

Document.ready? do
  Element.find('body > header').html = '<h1>Hi there!</h1>'
end
```




### As a template

You can use it for your views too, it even inherits instance and local variables from actions:

```ruby
# app/controllers/posts_controller.rb

def create
  @post = Post.create!(params[:post])
  render type: :js, locals: {comments_html: render_to_string(@post.comments)}
end
```

Each assign is filtered through JSON so it's reduced to basic types:

```ruby
# app/views/posts/create.js.opal

post = Element.find('.post')
post.find('.title').html    = @post[:title]
post.find('.body').html     = @post[:body]
post.find('.comments').html = comments_html
```

The auto inheritance of instance and local variables can be disabled globally or on a per controller basis:

```ruby

  # Globally disable:
  config.opal.auto_assign_instance_variables = false

  # Disable specific controllers (secondary) or specific actions (primary#without_assignments)
  config.opal.auto_assign_instance_variables = {
    except: ['primary#without_assignments', 'secondary']
  }

  # Enable specific controllers (secondary) or specific actions (primary#without_assignments)
  config.opal.auto_assign_instance_variables = {
    only: ['primary#without_assignments', 'secondary']
  }

```

### As a Haml filter (optional)

Of course you need to require `haml-rails` separately since its presence is not assumed

```haml
-# app/views/posts/show.html.haml

%article.post
  %h1.title= post.title
  .body= post.body

%a#show-comments Display Comments!

.comments(style="display:none;")
  - post.comments.each do |comment|
    .comment= comment.body

:opal
  Document.ready? do
    Element.find('#show-comments').on :click do |click|
      click.prevent_default
      click.current_target.hide
      Element.find('.comments').effect(:fade_in)
    end
  end

```


### RSpec support

_Extracted to [`opal-rspec-rails`](https://github.com/opal/opal-rspec-rails)_

Add this line to your `Gemfile`

```ruby
gem 'opal-rspec-rails', github: 'opal/opal-rspec-rails'
```

### Minitest support

_Upcoming as `opal-minitest-rails`_


### Shared templates

As long as the templates are inside the sprockets/opal load path, then you should be able to just require them.

Let's say we have this template `app/views/shared/test.haml`:

```haml
.row
  .col-sm-12
    = @bar
```

We need to make sure Opal can see and compile that template. So we need to add the path to sprockets:

```ruby
# config/initializers/opal.rb
Rails.application.config.assets.paths << Rails.root.join('app', 'views', 'shared').to_s
```

Now, somewhere in `application.rb` you need to require that template, and you can just run it through `Template`:

```ruby
# app/assets/javascripts/application.rb
require 'opal'
require 'opal-haml'
require 'test'

@bar = "hello world"

template = Template['test']
template.render(self)
# =>  '<div class="row"><div class="col-sm-12">hello world</div></div>'
```


### Using Ruby gems from Opal

Just use `Opal.use_gem` in your asset initializer (in `config/initializers`).

Example:

```ruby
Opal.use_gem 'cannonbol'
```
